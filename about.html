           <big><b> <p style="font-family: fantasy;">Set 2k21 are awesome set of students who started thier academic journey of secondary school in 2015.
            Six years on, we have been through a lot of things as students nevertheless, we never gave up.
            As the saying goes whatever does not kill you only makes you stronger,we have grown closer as friends and have bonded well amongst eachother.</p>
                <p style="font-family: fantasy;">We have encountered setbacks, but luckily we were able to overcome them all;such is the covid 19 and the complications it brought with it,that seperated us for months and the way most of us could communicate was through social media.
                    Though it seperated us,when we finally met we grew closer.</p>
                <p style="font-family: fantasy;">The impact of the corona virus on the educational sector was heaviest on our set.Not having access to direct schooling,teachers and not physically seeing and interacting with eachother prooved dificult.
                    We had to accept the online schooling system,the school system after resumption became alot faster and we were rushed so we could still graduate in 2021.
                </p><br/>
                <p style="font-family: fantasy;">We have also made some accomplishments in the school; we are the first and only set so far in Rantya High(RHS) School to offer 9 subjects right from SSS2.
                    We had a very good prefect list and our head boy was wonderful.We have our differences but I can say we are the most united set in RHS different in our entities.
                we have issues amongst ourselves we fight but we always settle.We got on the wrong side of teachers but we were able to win them over.
                We were also able to change Mr Soji's mind about us.We have survived and have been through alot together.United we have been through it all.
